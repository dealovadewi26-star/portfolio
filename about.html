      <h1>About Her</h1>
      <p>
        She's an Information System student who finds beauty in structure — both in systems and design.
        Her name is De, and she believes technology isn’t just about logic but about connection and empathy.
      </p>
      <p>
        She enjoys creating calm, meaningful interfaces and learning how systems work behind the scenes — from ERP to web design.
        When she’s not working, she journals, drinks matcha, and rearranges layouts until they feel right.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Design, to her, is a way of building quiet confidence — a reflection of who she is and who she’s becoming.”
      </blockquote>
